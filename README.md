# Introduction
Welcome to our DSC 80 final project, where we aim to explore and gain insights focused on major power outage risks in the United States.  Over the past two decades, America has experienced numerous major outages, thus affecting millions of individuals causing numerous disruptions across the country. These outages highlight the urgent need for proactive measures to mitigate risks and enhance the resilience of our electrical grid.

The main question we are interested in addressing is (question). We will perform meticulous exploration and analysis to help guide us throughout the project. Ultimately we plan on performing (classification or regression) to (address goal).

Our dataset, derived from the article titled 'A Multi-Hazard Approach to Assess Severe Weather-Induced Major Power Outage Risks in the U.S.' by Mukherjee et al. (2018), covers the period from January 2000 to July 2016. It provides comprehensive information about severe weather-induced major power outages in the United States, including the geographical locations of the outages, regional climatic data, land-use characteristics, electricity consumption patterns, and economic indicators of the states affected by the outages. As defined by the Department of Energy, the major outages refer to those that impacted at least 50,000 customers or caused an unplanned firm load loss of at least 300â€¯MW. The dataset, after simple formatting, contains a total of 1534 rows and 56 columns.  The key columns are listed below:

~~~~~~~~~
null: The mean outage duration for power outages caused by "cold" weather is equal to the mean outage duration for power outages caused by "warm" weather.
alternative: the mean outage duration for power outages caused by "cold" weather is different from the mean outage duration for power outages caused by "warm" weather.
